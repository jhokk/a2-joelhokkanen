Assignment 2 - Short Stack: Basic Two-tier Web Application using HTML/CSS/JS and Node.js  

## Class Manager
This site allows the user to add students to a class roster by inputting the information into a form. Students can also be removed by selecting any number of entries and clicking the delete button. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I created a single-page application that displays the data and updates it whenever an entry is added or removed. I used the left column to provide the form and the right column to display the data. In order to make this work, I needed to learn a lot about how the node.js requests and responses work as well as how more effectively use css selectors. It also took a lot of time to figure out how to implement the deletion button, as I originally planned to make the fields able to be modified as well but ran out of time, causing me to slightly rethink my design.
